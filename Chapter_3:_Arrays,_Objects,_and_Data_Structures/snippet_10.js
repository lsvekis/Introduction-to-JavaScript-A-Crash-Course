Introduction to Objects
Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. They allow you to model complex data and real-world entities by grouping related data and functions (called methods) together.
Detailed Explanation
Creating Objects: Objects are defined using curly braces {} with key-value pairs.
Accessing Properties: Use dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object["property"]).
Modifying Objects: You can add, update, or remove properties at any time.
Methods: Functions defined inside objects that operate on the objectâ€™s data.
Coding Tips
Tip 1: Use descriptive property names to make your objects more understandable.
Tip 2: When using bracket notation, property names should be strings.
Tip 3: Use object destructuring to extract values from an object for cleaner code.
