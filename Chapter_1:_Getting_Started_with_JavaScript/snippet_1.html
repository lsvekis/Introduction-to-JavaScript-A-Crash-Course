Setting Up Your Development Environment
Before writing any code, you need a proper development environment. This section guides you through installing a code editor, creating your first HTML file, and accessing your browserâ€™s console.
Detailed Steps
Code Editor: Use a modern code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write your code. These editors offer syntax highlighting and useful features that improve your coding workflow.
