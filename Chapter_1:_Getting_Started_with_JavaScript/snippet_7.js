Variables and Data Types
Variables are containers for storing data. JavaScript supports various data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans. You declare variables using keywords like let and const.

Data Types:
String: Text enclosed in quotes, e.g., "Hello".
Number: Numeric values, e.g., 42 or 3.14.
Boolean: Logical values, either true or false.
